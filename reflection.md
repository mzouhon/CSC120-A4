- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I like how encapsulation makes it easier to break down complicated programs into manageable parts. It made it easier test parts of my program without having the whole program finished and I was easily able to verify that a class worked before moving on to the next one. While it can be a bit confusing at first, once you figure out how the classes work together, the main project starts making sense. Most of the methods were pretty straightforward and I was easily able to figure out what the project end-goal was supposed to look like. However, it was a bit difficult to remember what classes did what and how to access the same attribute from different classes. I would advise allocating a substantial amount of time to testing each class because there are so many parts.
